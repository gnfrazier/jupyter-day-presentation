## Slides

The slides notebook requires a conda environment based on environment.yml and the same [developer.here.com](https://developer.here.com/) api key from my [isochrone demo](https://github.com/gnfrazier/Isochrone_Demo).

## Demoapp

Follow the instructions in the readme for the [isochrone demo](https://github.com/gnfrazier/Isochrone_Demo). Then run the isochrones-ui notebook.
